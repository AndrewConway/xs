<title>Deployment of XS</title>

  <h2>Server side, code</h2>
  <p>You will need the xs code base. This can either be a compiled xs.jar or compiled from the source code in the xs project of the xs repository.
  There are two dependent third party library, jackson-core (MIT license), and mongo-java-driver (Apache license). 
  The code is tested and compiled against version 2.1.1 of jackson-core and 2.11.1 of mongo-java-driver, but different versions are likely
  to work. jackson-core is only used for the HTML interface and JSON serialization; if you just want to use the XML serialization you do not need to include it.</p>
 
  <p>If you are running the demo, you will also need to include the code in the xs-test project of the xs repository.

  <h2>Javascript/css/etc resources</h2>
  
  <p>xs has its own set of needed resources located in the /WebContent/xs folder of the xs project of the xs repository. These should
  be included in some place accessible to clients (in an Eclipse Servlet project, they could be in /WebContent/xs; in Play they could
  be in /public/xs. You are welcome to put them elsewhere, just make sure that your html files point to the correct place. There are also
  a variety of third party libraries used:</p>

  <h2>Demos</h2>
  
  <p>Demos are available for a servlet container and inside Play. Both are present as appropriately named folders in the repository <a href="https://github.com/AndrewConway/xsdemo">xsdemo</a>. Both
  may run as Eclipse projects.</p>
  
  <p>The way resources are handled in these demos is a MESS. In particular, the third party resources are held in a canonical folder "xs-ThirdPartyWebContent". However there is
  no easy way in Eclipse that I can find that works well with git to include them in the servlet of play deployment directories. Thus they are copied in by hand
  (well, by ant script) to both places. Similarly, the xs WebContent resources are held in the canonical folder "xs/WebContent" of the main xs folder,
  and are also copied by ant script. Sorry for this mess - advice on resolution appreciated (particularly if it is simple, which does not include Maven or sbt).
  Class files and libraries are also needed. This should be handled automatically by the eclipse deployment mechanism for the servlet demo (which means
  you need the xs and xs-test projects open in eclipse to run it - you may also need to adjust the Scala library path if you have a different version to me).
  For play it has to be copied in by hand (well, a Jar file is made by ant), which means that the ant needs to be rerun when the source
  files change in the xs project, or if you upgrade to a new version of Scala that is link-incompatible. Sorry for this mess. This is the main
  reason why xs is broken up into two git repositories "xs" and "xs-demo". The former is clean, the latter is a mess and may be replaced at
  some point in the future.

  <h2>What your code must do</h2>
  
  <p>This is an overview only; I suggest you try one of the above demos for complete examples. Generally you must use XS in an HTML file, and you
  must also provide the information channel.</p>
  
  <h3>Using html page</h3>

  <p>If you want to edit an object <code>O</code>, then you need to create an editing object <code>XSEdit</code>. The constructor takes <code>O</code> as
  the first argument, and optionally an external resource resolver (see its Scaladocs) as a second argument. This holds the current state of the object and
  the paraphenalia needed to edit it. Each actual web page that edits it needs its own <code>HTML5Client</code> object, the constructor of which takes
  the <code>XSEdit</code> as the first argument and a locale as the second. You would typically only have one client per <code>XSEdit</code> object, but
  you can have multiple ones per object if you want different web pages to edit the same object (and see each others' edits in real time). The demos
  both have just one object being edited with multiple clients.</p> 
  
  <p>The html page then needs the following things:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Javascript and css references for xs and the libraries above. See the demos for a complete list.</li>
    <li>In the body somewhere, <code>client.baseHTML</code> where <code>client</code> is the <code>HTML5Client</code> object above.</li>
    <li>Optionally, information channel URLs. See section below.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>It is possible to have multiple clients in a single web page - each will then have its own information channel.</p>
  
  
  <h3>Information Channel</h3>
  
  <p>The information channel really consists of two independent channels, one for sending data to the server and one for sending data
  to the client. (future feature - support websockets). These need URLs obviously; the default is to use the current web
  page with a different query string - see the servlet example - but they can be overwritten to custom URLs by including a script
  such as the following (from the Play example) in the main web page:</p>
  <pre>
             xs.cometURL = '/xsComet';
             xs.userURL = '/xsUser'; 
  </pre>
  <p>Both calls will contain a query string containing a session identifier which is used to work out which
  client is being spoken to. This string can be decoded via <code>SessionManagement.get(sessionID)</code>.</p>
  
  
  <p>The comet call should be processed via <code>session.cometCallFuture</code> which returns a future (with a ten second timeout) of
  the message to return (which can be serialized via its <code>serialize</code> method). The Play example uses futures nicely; the
  servlet example ties up a thread waiting on it (this is not good practice and you should not do it in production but it is more portable
  for the demo). If you are using a servlet holder that cannot create threads then instead of  <code>session.cometCallFuture</code> 
  you can call <code>session.cometCallBlocking()</code> which will block - this is undesirable unless absolutely necessary.</p>
  
  <p>The client call should have its contents deserialized by <code>ClientMessage.deserialize(request.getInputStream())</code>, and
  then pass it to <code>session.receivedPossiblyUnorderedMessage(message, messageCount)</code> where <code>message</code> is
  the deserialized message and <code>messageCount</code> comes from the URL query string. See the demos for details.
  A return acknowledgement should be sent of the result from <code>session.receivedPossiblyUnorderedMessage(message, messageCount)</code>.</p>
