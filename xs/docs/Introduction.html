<title>Introduction to XS</title>
</head>
<body>
  <p>XS is provides a high quality editor and XML/JSON serialization/deserialization for Scala classes that form a tree. 
  This introduction provides an introduction to the main concepts. More details are available in the Javadocs for the annotations.</p>
  
  <h2>XS Classes and fields</h2>
           <aside>Refers to package <code>org.greatcactus.xs.api</code></aside>
  
  <p>A class can be handled by XS if it has the <code>@XS</code> annotation, and contains a constructor listing some suitable, possibly annotated, fields (vals or vars).
  If the class has multiple constructors then the desired one should be annotated with <code>@XSConstructor</code>.
  There is one field created for each argument to the constructor; its name is the name of the argument (overridable by the <code>@XSName</code> annotation)
  A field is suitable if it is:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A class that can be handled by XS</li>
    <li>A class that can be indirectly handled by XS. This is a superclass of some other class(es) that are themselves handled directly or indirectly by XS. 
    Such a class must be annotated with <code>@XS</code> and <code>@XSSubclasses</code>, with the 
    latter annotation listing all the subclasses.</li>
    <li>A primitive (Int,Double,Char,Byte,Long,Float,Boolean)</li>
    <li>A string</li>
    <li>A Java enumeration</li>
    <li>Some class that can be converted to a string by toString (ie everything) and from a string by a method taking a string as an argument. Places looked (in order of precendence):
      <ul>
        <li>an <code>apply</code> method in the companion object (a common Scala idiom)</li>
        <li>a static <code>valueOf</code> member (a common Java idiom, including some useful Java standard library functions)</li>
        <li>a constructor for the class</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
    <li>An array, List, Seq, IndexedSeq, Set, or Option of one of the above types.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>This covers a large number of practical data structures. It does not allow collections of collections or Tuples directly, 
  although these can readily be dealt with by making a wrapper class holding the inner collection. (eg. a matrix could not be stored as an array of arrays of doubles, but
  it could be stored as an array of rows, where each row was a class containing a single field being an array of doubles).</p>
  
  <h4>Serialization</h4>
           <aside>Refers to package <code>org.greatcactus.xs.api.serialization</code></aside>
  
  <h5>XML serialization</h5>
  <p>This is generally all the information needed for serialization. Such a class will be serialized into a XML structure with tag name
  the class' name (override by <code>@XSName</code>), attributes with the fields serialized to Strings (unless annotated by <code>@XSSerializeAsBlock</code>), 
  and nested XML elements for the other fields.</p>
  <p> Collections are serialized for attributes as semicolon separated strings (semicolons and backquotes are then escaped by backquotes). Collections for other
  fields consist of multiple instances of the sub tag. Fields that are null or empty collections have their corresponding attribute or subtag left out. This means that
  Some(null), None, and null all serialize to the same thing - XS is not the library for you if you routinely want to distinguish these. What a missing field deserializes to depends
  upon the type: if the type is a collection, it deserializes to an empty collection. Otherwise it deserializes to null. Note that the serializer can distinguish None from
  Some("") which the editor cannot distinguish.  </p>
  <p>Polymorphic fields are distinguished by having the sub field have tag name be the name of the class. This causes problems if there are two fields that could
  contain the same class. This ambiguity is resolved by wrapping the fields with the field name via <code>@XSWrapper</code></p>
  
  <p>Backwards compatability when field names change can be provided with <code>@XSObsoleteName</code>
  <p>UTF8 encoding is used.</p>
  
  <p>You can now serialize an object to a stream or byte array via the appropriate method in the object <code>XMLSerialize</code>. You can deserialize
  an object using <code>XMLDeserialize.deserialize</code>. A code example that defines a class, serializes it, and then deserializes it is shown below:
<pre>
@XS class Complex(val r:Double,val i:Double)
val c = new Complex(0.6,0.8)
val serializedData : Array[Byte] = XMLSerialize.serializeToByteArray(c)
val deserialized : Complex = XMLDeserialize.deserialize[Complex](serializedData)
</pre>
  
  <h5>JSON serialization</h5>
  <p>Usage and general idea is similar to XML serialization, except just the <code>JSONSerialize</code> and <code>JSONDeserialize</code> classes.</p>
  
  <p>Polymorphism causes different problems; working out what class a field is. For this reason each object, when serialized contains an explicit
  field called <code>"xsType"</code> set to a string specifying the name of the actual type. This field must be listed first for deserialization
  to work. <code>@XSWrapper</code> is not needed and will be ignored.</p>
  
  <p>More specifically, an xs object is serialized with JSON fields for all its non-empty fields, plus "xsType" with the name of the class being serialized.
  Fields are serialized as follows:<p>
  <ul>
   <li>Numbers/booleans are serialized as the appropriate JSON primitive.</li>
   <li>Other non-XS fields are serialized as strings (as in XML serialization).  </li>
   <li>non-empty collections (other than option) are serialized as a JSON array</li>
   <li>non-null object fields, or non-empty options, are serialized as a JSON object</li>
  </ul>

  <h5>URL query string serialization</h5>
  <p>This enables serialization to a URL query string. Of course, due to browser limitations, this is generally only useful for small data structures. It is
  really slightly more general than URLs as it really serializes to key/value string pairs pairs (a scala Map). 
  This is converted to a RUL query string in the natural way. See <code>StringMapSerialize</code> javadocs for format details. </p>
  
  <p>To serialize, use <code>StringMapSerialize.serialize(obj)</code> to serialize to a map, and <code>StringMapSerialize.toURL(obj)</code> 
  to serialize to a URL query string (without the leading <code>?</code>). To deserialize, use <code>StringMapDeserialize.deserialize(map)</code> 
  or  <code>StringMapDeserialize.deserializeURL(string)</code>.
  
  <p>The field names should be valid URL query string characters. The field values will be url-escaped as UTF-8.</p> 
     
   <h2>Editing</h2>
         <aside>Refers to package <code>org.greatcactus.xs.api.edit</code></aside>
   
   <p>Editing requires extra annotations on the fields to describe how to edit them. The basic editing paradigm is that the hierarchical structure
   is represented as a tree (typically on the left hand side of the edit window), with individual nodes having fields that can be edited
   (on the right hand side). Fields that hold <code>@XS</code> annotated objects are usually annotated with <code>@IndividuallyEditable</code>
   which means they should be represented by new nodes in the tree. They can also be left unannotated, in which case they will be preserved but
   not displayed, or annotated with <code>@TableEditable</code> which means they will be displayed as a grid (think Excel). They
   can also be annotated with <code>@InlineEditable</code> which means they will be displayed as multiple blocks inside the current
   view.</p>
   
   <p>Fields that are serialized to strings are generally edited as fields on the right hand side. They can be edited
   as checkboxes via <code>@BooleanEditable</code>, as strings via <code>@StringEditable</code> (this includes numbers, 
   and also enumerations [Java, <code>FiniteOptionList</code> implementors or explicitly listed with the help of <code>@RequiredOptions</code>]), 
   and as image URLs via <code>@ImageEditable</code>.</p>
   <table>
    <caption>There are a host of extra annotatations that modify how the editing is done.</caption>

    </tbody>
   </table>
    
   <h4>Editing other than just by fields</h4>
   <p>The normal XS editing paradigm is the user edits a field leads to a new object of the class containing the field is created with all fields the same
   as the old class except the one being altered.</p>
   
   <p>Sometimes you might want a field being edited to behave differently - if editing one field should change other fields. This can be done
   by annotating with <code>@FieldUpdater</code> a method on the class with the field that takes the new value of said field as an argument and
   produces a new object of the class containing the field. This method will then be called instead of the normal updating.</p>
   
   <p>Also you may want some command that changes a class somehow - like converting the first letter of each field to uppercase. This
   can be accomplished using <code>@XSEditCommands</code> (look at the javadocs for details).</p>
   
   <h3>Customising display - text, icons, sections and extra fields </h3>
      <aside>Refers to package <code>org.greatcactus.xs.api.display</code></aside>

   <h4>Extra fields</h4>
   <p>Extra (read only) fields can be created by putting the <code>@ExtraDisplayField</code> annotation on a method of a class. This field should then have the appropriate 
   modifiers listed above (e.g. <code>@XSStringEditable</code>, <code>@EditSection</code>, etc.).</p>

   <h4>Text</h4>   
   <p>There is a variety of text needed for labels and headings. This is handled via the standard ".properties" files used
   for Java localization. Details are given <a href="Localization.html">here</a>.</p>
      
   <p>Sometimes you will want more control over the labels (for instance, they may be a function of the object itself). For this
   you can use the <code>@LabelProvider</code> annotation on a method of the class. The annotation should take an argument which
   is the name of the field it is providing a label for. This allows programmatic creation of labels in a variety of forms
   (see the <code>@LabelProvider</code> JavaDocs for details) including HTML (see the <code>RichLabel</code> class).</p>
   
   <p>Tree nodes are generally labeled via the <code>toString</code> method of the node in question. This can be overridden 
   by a method with the <code>@LabelProvider</code> annotation and no arguments.</p>
      
   <h4>Icons</h4>
   <p>Icons for both fields and tree nodes come from the <code>@XSIcon</code> annotation on the field or class. This can be
   overridden in a very similar manner to the  <code>@LabelProvider</code> except with this time <code>@IconProvider</code>.
   See the Javadocs and <a href="Icons.html">icon document</a> for details.</p>
   
   <h4>Tooltips</h4>
   <p>Tooltips can be provided via the <code>@TooltipProvider</code> which is very similar to the <code>@LabelProvider</code>.
   These are tooltips for the actual gui element; tooltips for the label come from the localization text resources.</p>
   
   <h4>Visibility</h4>
   
   <p>Fields can have their visibility be controlled programmatically by methods with the <code>@VisibilityController</code> annotation.
   Disabling is also possible with the <code>@EnabledController</code> annotation, although implementation of <code>@EnabledController</code> is patchy.</p>
   
   <h4>Sections</h4>
    <p>Sections are groups of fields that can be displayed together, possibly with a heading.</p>
    
    <p>Fields by default will go in the "Main" section, but this can be changed by the <code>@EditSection</code> option. Sections are ordered alphabetically.</p> 
   
    <p>The providers and controllers above can also be applied to sections by using the section name prepended by "Section." as the argument.</p>    
    
      
   <h4>Templates</h4>
   <p>Sometimes you may want more control over the layout than the standard one-field-per-line XS approach. You can define a template
   file containing an html fragment that is used instead of the standard layout for that file. This should be in a file in the same
   package as the class, with name "classname".template.xml (similar to properties files), and should be a valid xml file. Fields and
   labels can be inserted into this tamplate: field "abc" will be inserted with a node called <code>field:abc</code>; labels with
   <code>label:abc</code>, and a two column wide table row with the label in the LHS and field in the RHS for <code>tr:abc</code> 
   (<code>line:abc</code> if you want it prewrapped in a table). If you want your field (label) wrapped in an inline-block, you can
   use <code>fieldib:abc</code> (<code>labelib:abc</code>) - either of which can take an attribute <code>width</code> with an
   approriate css value. <code>xs:pack</code> is a utility which will process the contents of the node, dropping trailing whitespace,
   and make the contents into a line with the last child taking up the rest of the line.</p> 
   
   <h3>Errors</h3>
      <aside>Refers to package <code>org.greatcactus.xs.api.errors</code></aside>
   
   <p>One of the most powerful features of XS is the ability to mark errors and warnings on the editor. Errors and Warnings are
   always associated with a particular object. They may also be associated with a particular field for that object. If so, and the item
   is a collection, they can be associated with a particular element of the collection. Lastly, they can be associated with particular
   indices in the text representation of a field element.</p>
   
   <p>Errors are computed programatically via methods on the object in question annotated with <code>@ErrorCheck</code>, with an
   optional arguement of the field name. This function should return zero or more instances of class <code>XSError</code> 
   (see the Javadocs for a list of valid return types and localization information).</p>
   
   <table>
    <caption>There are a variety of extra annotatations on fields that compute commonly used errors automatically. Look at the Javadocs for detailed usage information.</caption>
    <thead>
      <tr><th>Annotation</th><th>Error condition</th></tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
     <tr><td><code>@ErrorIfBlank</code></td><td>If blank/None is invalid (including as an element of a collection).</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>@ErrorIfEmptyCollection</code></td><td>If a collection should have at least one element.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>@ErrorIfNotGloballyUnique</code></td><td>If some other object has the same value for said field. The implementation is reasonably efficient, but can still be slow for very large objects.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>@ErrorIfNotUniqueInObject</code></td><td>If this field value is repeated somewhere else in the same object (eg a list of include files, you don't want the same file twice).</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>@ErrorIfNotUniqueInParent</code></td><td>If this field value is repeated somewhere else in a different child of the same parent (part way between <code>@ErrorIfNotUniqueInObject</code> and <code>@ErrorIfNotGloballyUnique</code>).</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>@ErrorIfNegative</code></td><td>If this field is not a positive or zero number.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>@ErrorIfNotNumber</code></td><td>If this field is not a number.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>@ErrorIfNotRegex</code></td><td>If this field is not a regular expression.</td></tr>
     <tr><td><code>@ErrorIfNotSuffix</code></td><td>If this field does not have a suffix.</td></tr>
    </tbody>
   </table>
       
   <h3>Dependency Injection</h3>
   
   <aside>Refers to package <code>org.greatcactus.xs.api.dependency</code></aside>
   
   <p>It is clear that the <code>@ErrorIfNotUniqueInObject</code> error can be computed by a custom method annotated by <code>@ErrorCheck</code>. But the global uniqueness checks are
   problematic as an object generally does not have access to its parents. This is an important architectural design choice as it means updates can be done reusing the majority
   of a complex data structure, improving performance, memory footprint and reliability. This problem is solved by letting the methods annotated by <code>@ExtraDisplayField</code>,
   <code>@LabelProvider</code>, or indeed any other such annotation have arguments. XS will then provide arguments (if possible) to the methods based on their type (dependency
   injection). For instance, to access the parent of an object you can use
   <pre>
        @LabelProvider("distanceFromPrimary") private def fancyHomeLabel(parent:Parent[HeavenlyBody]) = "Distance from "+parent.get.name
   </pre>
   
   
   <p>XS will provide the <code>Parent</code> wrapper around the actual parent. (It will also supply, if requested, a <code>IndexInParentField</code> object - see
   <code>SystemProvidedDependencies.scala</code> for details).
   You can also create your own classes that will be provided by having a method annotated
   with <code>@DependencyProvider</code>. The result (if any) of this will can then be used in other methods of the same object, or children if it is annotated
   with <code>@PropagateToChildren</code> (or both if annotated with both).</p>
   
   <p>Efficiency is an issue here and XS does a variety of optimizations to avoid recomputing dependencies when things have not changed. You can help by adding
   the <code>@OnlyAffectedByFields</code> annotation to a <code>@DependencyProvider</code> method, and list the names of the fields that cause it to need to be recomputed.
   Note that this means that dependency providers can be used for more than just gaining functionality; they can also be used to improve performance. Suppose you 
   have two fields, such that a computationally expensive parse of the first field is needed for the error checking for either. Rather than having two <code>@ErrorCheck</code>
   methods, both of which compute the parse, you can have one <code>@DependencyProvider</code> method that does the parse and returns it in some wrapper object, 
   and then two simpler and faster <code>@ErrorCheck</code> functions that take the parsed result as an argument. Of course in many cases you can accomplish the same
   task using private and or lazy fields rather than <code>@DependencyProvider</code>, but not if the parent is needed.</p>
   
   <p>A function annotated by <code>@OnlyAffectedByFields</code> and also having its own arguments is reevaluated if those arguments change (using != as the definition of change)
   even if the fields listed in <code>@OnlyAffectedByFields</code> do not change. Power user trick: a function taking arguments labeled <code>@OnlyAffectedByFields</code> with
   no fields listed will only be recomputed if the arguments change. This can be used for sophisticated caching of expensive computations.</p>
      
   <p>Sometimes you may want to block a dependency from being propagated to children. This can be done by putting the <code>@BlockDependencyInjection</code> annotation
   on the class and listing the classes of dependency to block. This is most useful if you have a class that wants to override some dependencies that would otherwise
   be propagated to children.</p>
   
   <p>The external context can directly add values to be dependency injected into the document using the XSEdit.setRootDependencyInjections function.</p>
      
   <h4>Long running computations</h4>
   <p>It is bad to have long running computations in the dependency injection system, as it will delay updating of everything else, and can cause
   time outs. Think of a traditional UI update thread - it is not quite that bad, but it is better to avoid.</p>
   
   <p>You can avoid it by returning a <code>scala.concurrent.future</code> value, which will be recomputed in some external thread, and then
   updated when appropriate. Even better, you can return <code>org.greatcactus.xs.util.InterruptableFuture</code> which will be interrupted
   if the value is not needed (which will happen frequently if every keypress in a text field initiates the dependency injection computation)</p>
   
   <h4>Results which depend on external, changing circumstances</h4>
  
   <p>Sometimes you may want to inject some information from outside the object. For instance, a field may be the name of a file. You may want error messages
   to depend upon the contents of the file. This would seem straight forward - just read the file in the <code>@ErrorCheck</code> method - but it does not
   handle the file changing under you in which case the error check function needs to be recomputed.</p>
   
   <p>There are two ways of dealing with this, both of which fundamentally share the same architecture - the idea is that XS provides a callback function
   which some external event calls when the result of a dependency injection function becomes obsolete. XS will then recompute that dependency function
   and anything dependent upon it</p>
   
   <p>The first method is explicit. A dependency provider function can have as an argument to a dependency injection
   function an element of type <code>OnObsoleteCallback</code>. This will be filled in by XS with a function that should be called when the result of the function
   becomes obsolete. Independently, (but in practice generally used at the same time) a dependency provider function may return a class of type <code>ExternallyChangingDependency</code>,
   which contains a callback called by XS when XS no longer is using the result of the function. This can also be used for resource cleaning.</p>
   
   <p>This seems somewhat similar to the <code>org.greatcactus.xs.util.InterruptableFuture</code> mentioned in the section above about long running
   computations, and indeed it frequently makes sense to combine these two. This can be messy if done explicitly using the method of the prior paragraph.
   A simpler method is to return a <code>org.greatcactus.xs.util.ObsoletableAndInterruptableFuture</code>, which combines the two. If you use this you
   do not need to have a <code>OnObsoleteCallback</code> in the method signature - XS will attach to the <code>ObsoletableAndInterruptableFuture</code>
   both for the notification from XS to to the external system and vice versa.</p>
   
   <p>Note that composing multiple operations that can be interruptable and obsoletable is quite a finnicky and error prone thing to do; I suggest
   using the monadic functions on the <code>ObsoletableAndInterruptableFuture</code> class that take care of everything for you and can be used 
   inside a for comprehension for quite simple and easy to read code. They can be basically used the same way as the normal <code>scala.concurrent.Future</code>.</p>
      
      
   <h3>Custom editors</h3>
   <p>Sometimes you want something special, and the XS editors are not sufficient. You can embed your own.</p>
   <p>On the data structure, make a dummy function (it may as well return Unit). Annotate this with <code>@CustomEditable</code> with the argument the name of your custom widget.
   This will make a new field with the name of the function (which can be localized and controlled as normal).</p>
   <p>On the server, you should make a custom controller (with the standard HTML client, it should implement org.greatcactus.xs.frontend.HTMLCustomComponent with the name 
   given as the argument to <code>@CustomEditable</code>. Register it with <code>org.greatcactus.xs.frontend.HTML5DetailsPane.addCustom</code>). See Javadocs for details.</p>
   
   <h4>Custom popup editors</h4>
   <p>Sometimes you want a custom editor, but of a fairly prescribed form, and don't want to make a completely
   custom editor. You can make popup editors for a <code>@StringEditable</code> field which are represented as a little button
   at the end of the text field. When the user clicks on the button, a modal dialog comes up (with custom content) which you deal with. When ok is
   pressed on the modal dialog, the dialog disappears and the field changes appropriately. To do this, annotate the <code>@StringEditable</code> field 
   with <code>@CustomPopup("name")</code> where <code>name</code> is the name of the custom element (of type <code>org.greatcactus.xs.frontend.CustomPopupComponent</code>). 
   As with the fully custom component, when using the standard HTML5 client, it should actually implement <code>org.greatcactus.xs.frontend.html.HTMLCustomPopupComponent</code>,
   and should be registered with <code>org.greatcactus.xs.frontend.HTML5DetailsPane.addCustom</code>. See Javadocs for details.</p>
   
   <h4>UpdateField</h4>
   <p>Sometimes XS is not quite sufficient, but a custom editor is very similar to something XS already provides.
   E.g. A document A refers to some external document B containing a list of questions. The document A should contain an
   array of answers to these questions, of length equal to the number of questions in document B. You would like to use
   the standard XS table editor for these questions, but need to impose a length condition. Such constraints can be imposed
   by having a <code>@DependencyInjection</code> function return an element of type <code>UpdateField</code>. This will
   cause the currently-being-edited node to be updated. See javadocs for details. Note that this is very dangerous and should be
   avoided if possible - it is easy to end up with type errors or infinite loops that are hard to detect and debug.
   Note that you may also want to use the <code>@MayNotAddChildren</code> and <code>@MayNotRemoveChildren</code> annotations
   in the example above.</p> 
   
   <h3>Commands</h3>
   <p>If you annotate a method with <code>@XSCommand</code> then it becomes an action button that will be executed (server side, of course) when the user clicks on it.
   The method can take arguments from the dependency injection list, as well as a <code>ProgressMonitor</code> (expected work 1.0) or <code>ProgressMonitorSource</code>, 
   which can give progress information back to the user.
   The method should return a <code>CommandResult</code> object. XS will then display a progress monitor and success status. The user can cancel if your (long running)
   server side process regularly checks the isCancelled method on the progress monitor. If your method throws a <code>CancelledThrowable</code> exception then
   the status shown on the client will be cancelled. If some other exception is thrown, a stack trace will be shown on the client (so catch them yourself and give a
   pretty status using <code>CommandResult</code>. 
   
   <h3>Updating URLs with status</h3>
   <p>As a user edits a document, you may want the URL in the browser to change with it. There are two ways of doing this:</p>
   <ul>
     <li>Just the selected tree element : set <code>HTML5Client.detailsPane.shouldStoreSelectedOnClient=true</code> on your client. This will store
         a somewhat-permalink representation of the currently selected element of the tree as the query string in the URL. To use an old permalink,
         <code>HTML5Client.xsedit.setSelectedViaPermalink(s)</code>. </li>
     <li>The whole document being edited : set <code>HTML5Client.storeWholeEditedObjectInURL=true</code> on your client. This will store the whole
         object in the URL. Don't do this with big objects! To use this, use <code>StringMapDeserialize.deserializeURL</code>. </li>
   </ul>
   
   <h2>Other ways of using it</h2>
   There are a variety of components in XS that are of use in their own right outside of XS
   <h3>HTML Tree Browser</h3>
   The tree component can be used by itself by making an appropriate model. ( TODO make demo ).
   <h3>HTML details pane</h3>
   The details pane can also be used by itself. This could be useful if you have some complex form which can be represented by a Scala XS annotated data structure with a command on it. (TODO make demo)
   <h3>Pseudo text field</h3>
   Text fields in XS use content-editable divs rather than "input". This enables error syntax highlighting, but also enables auto-expanding multi-line which can be useful in other contexts. 
   If you want to use these outside of XS you will need to extract the xsPTF.js file and some of the css.
