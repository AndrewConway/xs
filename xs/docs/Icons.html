  <p>Icons are used by XS for fields (generally displayed near the label) and for classes (generally displayed in the tree view near the node name).
  As the same icon is used in multiple circumstances, and there may be different formats depending upon the front end, there is a level of
  indirection between the logical description of an icon at the XS api level, and the physical picture that is displayed.</p>
  
  <p>The simplest way to associate an icon with a field or class is to use the <code>@XSIcon</code> annotation on the field or class.
  This annotation contains an argument which is a string naming the icon. XS will then look through its manifests for an icon that
  matches that name. E.g. <code>@XSIcon("Star")</code>. </p>
  
  <p>A manifest for XS consists of a text file <code>xsicons.manifest</code> and associated image files. The file consists of
  a set of entries. Each entry starts with a line like <code>[Star]</code> meaning that this entry matches the logical icon
  name "Star". Subsequent lines may be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The name of an image file in the same directory, like <code>Star.jpg</code></li>
    <li>The name of an image file in the same directory, preceded by an integer and equals sign, like <code>32=Star32x32.jpg</code>. The integer is an estimate of the height of the icon in pixels,
    and is used by XS to choose the most appropriate format when more than one file is included.</li>
    <li>A line starting with <code>Copyright=</code>. This is for internal documentation if third party images are used.</li>
    <li>Comments starting with the <code>#</code> character</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>The sample application manifest file is included below as an example.</p>

  <p>There can be multiple manifest files. XS will search in the following places in order (in the classpath):</p>
  <ul>
    <li>In the package the class referring to it is located in</li>
    <li>In sub packages of said class</li>
    <li>In the /xsicons directory of the classpath</li>
  </ul>  
  
  <p>An <code>@IconProvider</code> annotated method can return a string (which will be interpreted as above), or a <code>Icon</code> or <code>ConcreteIcon</code> class. 
  If you want a fully custom file you can use <code>Icon.ofURL</code>, which can be used with a "data:" URL.</p>
