  <h1>How network connections work under the cover for the web front end</h1>
  <p>In the big picture, every time you change something in the browser, a description of the change
  gets sent to the server. Similarly, whenever the server wants to change something on the client it
  sends a packet to the client. This may be in response to a just done edit from the client, or it may
  come from some external source (including a delayed error computation).</p> 
  
  <p>But the details get more complex.</p>
  
  <p>Many changes are processed 
  automatically on the client without needing to talk to the server to get an instant response for a more
  snappy UI. In particular, opening and closing tree branches is done on the client - the server
  preemptively makes sure the client knows about the children of all visible nodes.</p>
  
  <p>Another major issue is that in the long stream of change packets, it is possible some commands may get lost
  or reordered. This could lead to data corruption and so it is important to get right, particularly since many
  of the packets' results are invisible to the user - they tell the server about changes already showing on the client. Thus
  we cannot just use the the normal http model whereby connections are assumed to be reliable, and if they aren't 
  it will be obvious the the user who manually presses the refresh button. Most of the rest of this 
  document covers this case.</p>
  
  <p>There is also the possibility of one web page containing two different xs editors, and the server needing
  to distinguish these. This is straight forward - each xs editor gets its own independent communication channel -
  everything hereafter is repeated for each editor.</p>
  
  <p>Note on nomenclature: I talk about "packets" frequently. These are not actual IP packets, but are really
  HTTP requests and responses. However the way they are processed is comparable to the way packets are processed, and so I use
  the loose language.</p>
  
  <h2>Tracking packet order - client to server</h2>
  
  <p>When the browser sends the server a command, it contains the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>A session ID string indicating which xs editor it pertains to.</li>
    <li>A packet sequence number, starting at 0 for the first packet for this session, 1 for the second packet, etc. </li>
    <li>The message itself</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The server keeps a count of the last packet sequence number processed. If an incoming packet has the expected
  next sequence number, it gets processed immediately, and the sequence count for that session is incremented. If the
  count is smaller than the expected next, it is assumed to be a resend of an incorrectly assumed lost command, and is ignored.
  If the count is higher than the expected next value, it is assumed to be an out-of-order packet, and is saved for later. When
  all messages up to it have arrived, it will be processed.</p>
  
  <p>This guarantees sequential processing, but it will cause the server to wait forever for a missing packet if a packet is
  lost. For this we have a request for resend system based around acknowledgements returned as a response to the packets from
  the browser. In particular, each packet sent from the client to the server produces a response with three numbers:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The sequence number of the packet just received</li>
    <li>The sequence number of the next packet to be processed (usually 1 more than the packet just received, but may be lower if earlier packets are missing or higher if this packet enabled subsequent stored packets to be processed)</li>
    <li>The largest sequence number of packet to be received.</li> 
  </ul>
  
  <p>When the browser sends a packet off, it saves it in a buffer. When an acknowledgement is received, then that packet
  gets deleted from the buffer. Furthermore, any sequence numbers less than that of the next packet to be processed can also
  be deleted (this will only matter if a previous acknowledgement got lost in the network).</p>
  
  <p>If the sequence number of the next packet to be processed is less than the current packet, it means that an earlier packet has
  got lost or delayed. The browser code will assume it has got lost, and resend the next desired packet (if it hasn't arrived after 
  another half a second delay, in case it was delayed). If it was just delayed - and  
  therefore arrives twice - it does not matter - it will be ignored by the client.</p>
  
  <p>One more problem to deal with is time outs. If no acknowledgements for a packet have arrived ten seconds after sending it, it will be resent.</p>
  
  <p>This protocol is not efficient in the case of many packet losses and reorderings, but is simple and has almost no overhead
  in the common case of almost no packet losses or reorderings.</p> 
  
  <h2>What about Websockets?</h2>
  <p>These would efficiently and simply solve many of the problems above, but are not available in all browsers (or servers). Forthcoming feature.</p>
  
  <h2>What else</h2>
  <p>Packets that involve messages about a change to a field are problematic in that delays could produce incorrect answers. If the server sends
  a command the the browser to change the tree node being edited, and that message to the browser crosses on the wire with a command from
  the client to change a particular field, then when it arrives at the server (still in order), it will reference the old node. This will 
  rarely occur, usually if the user presses on a new node in the tree and them immediately edits a field before the server has had a chance
  to update the fields. In this case it is not clear whether the user intended to update the field for the new or old object.</p>
  
  <p> XS detects this
  by having packets involving editing a field also send back an identifier for the tree object being edited. If this differs from what the
  server thinks should have been edited, then there is a problem. The resolution is to ignore that edit. There are good arguments for
  other approaches, but also good arguments against them. The main rationale for this approach is that the standard "web failure" model
  most people think of is that the try doing something and nothing happens. This is annoying but familiar. Trying to do something and
  have the something occur <em>but not the the desired object</em> is unintuitive and, in my opinion, worse. Sorry if you disagree. </p>
  
  <h2>Server to client commands</h2>
  <p>These also need to be in order. However, a lost packet is not as serious as a lost client to server command, as it will have a more
  intuitive result (lost connection; screen doesn't update; refresh fixes things). A comet approach is used. The client sends a 
  request to the server which delays up to ten seconds for a response. If it has some commands to send, it sends all of them as a response
  to the comet request. Comet requests get resent by the browser when the server responds or errors. This will preserve sequence, although
  possibly lose packets.</p>
